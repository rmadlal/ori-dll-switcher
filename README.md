### Easily switch to a different dll in Ori DE. ###

This program will locate the requested dll and copy it into `...\Ori DE\oriDE_Data\Managed` with the name `Assembly-CSharp.dll` for you.

Download `dll_switcher.py` and run it (double-click should work, but if not, run the command `python dll_switcher.py` in cmd). You can place this file anywhere (I'd put it in the Ori directory).

Click on "New" and choose a short name for your DLL (e.g "rando", "nopause" etc). Then click on "Locate DLL" and select the proper file. Finally, hit "Apply".  
DLL names will be saved so that you would simply pick your DLL from the list and click "Apply".
